Boggle is a game designed by Allan Turoff and published in 1972 by Parker Brothers.
The game is played by using a grid of lettered dice.
A player searches for words in the adjacent letters.

The original Boggle game uses a grid of 4*4 cubes, with letters on each
of the cube. This program models that correctly by having the specific
letters on each cube built into the program.

This version of Boggle is not timed.
