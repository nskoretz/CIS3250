Boggle is a game designed by Allan Turoff and published in 1972 by Parker Brothers.
The game is played by using a grid of lettered dice.
A player searches for words in the adjacent letters.

The original Boggle game uses a grid of 4*4 cubes, with letters on each
of the cube. This program models that correctly by having the specific
letters on each cube built into the program.

This program simulates the classic board game Boggle.
When the program is run, a "game board" is dipayed to the screen which models the
lettered dice in the real-world version of boggle.

The user then inputs any words they can find on the game board and they are presented
with a message indicating if their selection is valid or not, as well as their current score.

To end the game, the user simply types the letter 'q' as their selection and the game
will end and print the scoreboard to the screen.

This version of Boggle is not timed.
